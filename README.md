DESCRIPTION OF TASK : This project is about making a chat application where many users (clients) can talk to each other at the same time. It works using a server-client model. The ChatServer listens for new users who want to join and handles all the chatting. When a client connects, they can send messages to the server. The server then sends (broadcasts) the message to all other connected clients. 

To make sure everything runs smoothly even when many people are chatting, the server uses multithreading â€” this means giving each client a separate thread so they can chat without waiting for others. Messages are shown instantly to everyone, so the chat feels real-time. This project helps us understand how networking, sockets, and multithreading work together. It is a basic but strong system and can be improved later by adding features like private chats, saving chat history, and user login. We have also added error handling to make sure the server keeps running even if some problems happen.
